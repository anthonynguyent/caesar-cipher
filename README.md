# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project provides a web application that allows users to encrypt their text using the Caesar Cipher method.

## Features

-   Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher encryption technique.
-   Allows users to specify the shift value (1-25) to determine the encryption.
-   Provides a user-friendly interface with input fields for specifying the shift value and entering the plaintext.
-   Updates the translated text in real-time as the user types or changes the shift value.
-   Implements a responsive design for optimal viewing across different devices.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the plaintext in the textarea provided.
3. Specify the shift value in the input field (1-25).
4. The translated text will be displayed in real-time below the input fields.
5. Copy the encrypted text for further use or analysis.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

## Files Included

-   `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web application.
-   `style.css`: Provides styling rules for enhancing the visual presentation.
-   `script.js`: Implements the logic for encrypting text using the Caesar Cipher technique.
